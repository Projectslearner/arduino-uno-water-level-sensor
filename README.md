# Arduino Uno Water Level Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a water level sensor with an Arduino Uno. The sensor detects the presence or absence of water, providing feedback based on the water level.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Water Level Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup 

1. **Connect Water Level Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the water level sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the power (VCC) and ground (GND) of the water level sensor to the respective power and ground pins on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the water level sensor to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the output indicating "Water detected" or "No water detected" based on sensor input.

#### Applications

- **Water Level Monitoring:** Use in projects requiring water level monitoring, such as tank level indicators or automated watering systems.
- **Safety Systems:** Integrate with alarms or notifications for water presence detection in sensitive areas.
- **Educational Projects:** Learn about sensor integration and environmental monitoring using Arduino.

#### Notes

- Ensure the water level sensor is calibrated and positioned correctly for accurate detection.
- Adjust sensor placement and sensitivity based on the specific application requirements.
- Explore advanced water level sensors for additional features like analog output or extended detection ranges.
